                    <p>Please read these terms of service and Our Privacy Policy (together, these "Terms") carefully as they
                        form a contract between You and Us and govern use of and access to the Service(s) and Websites by
                        You, Your Affiliates, Users and End-Customers. In the event of a conflict between these terms of
                        service and Our Privacy Policy, these terms of service shall prevail.</p>

                    <p>By accessing or using the Service(s) or Websites, or authorizing or permitting any User or
                        End-Customer to access or use the Service(s) or Websites, You agree to be bound by these Terms. If
                        You are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company, organization or another legal entity (an
                        "Entity"), You are agreeing to these Terms for that Entity and representing to Us that You have the
                        authority to bind such Entity and its Affiliates to these Terms, in which case the terms, "You,"
                        "Your" or related capitalized terms used herein shall refer to such Entity and its Affiliates. If
                        You do not have such authority, or if You do not agree with these Terms, You must not accept these
                        Terms and may not access or use the Service(s) or Websites.</p>

                    <p>You, as an individual, must be 18 years or older to access or use the Websites and the Service(s).

                    <h3>DEFINITIONS</h3>
                    <p>When used in these Terms with the initial letters capitalized, in addition to terms defined elsewhere
                        in these Terms, the following terms have the following meanings:</p>

                        controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such party, whereby "control"
                        (including, with correlative meaning, the terms "controlled by" and "under common control") means
                        the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct, or cause the direction of the
                        management and policies of such person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by
